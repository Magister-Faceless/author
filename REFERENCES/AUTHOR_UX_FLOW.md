## User Experience Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Writing a New Chapter

**User Request:**
> "Help me write Chapter 5 of my fantasy novel. It should include an action scene where the protagonist discovers their hidden powers, and connect to the cliffhanger from Chapter 4."

**What the User Sees:**

1. **Immediate Response** (< 1 second)
   ```
   I'll help you write Chapter 5. This is a complex task, so let me create a plan to track our progress.
   ```

2. **Todo List Appears** (streaming in real-time)
   ```
   üìã Todo List Created:
   ‚òê Read Chapter 4 to understand the cliffhanger  
   ‚òê Create Chapter 5 outline with action scene  
   ‚òê Write the action scene  
   ‚òê Write character development sections  
   ‚òê Ensure smooth connection to Chapter 4  
   ‚òê Review and refine Chapter 5  
   ‚òê Create progress file documenting work  
   ```

3. **First Task Starts** (todo list updates)
   ```
   üìã Todo List Updated:
   üîß Read Chapter 4 to understand the cliffhanger  
   ‚òê Create Chapter 5 outline with action scene  
   ...
   ```

4. **Agent Works** (streaming text appears in real-time)
   ```
   Let me read Chapter 4 to understand the context...
   
   [Reads Chapter 4]
   
   I can see Chapter 4 ends with Kira trapped in the burning archive, 
   surrounded by soldiers. Perfect setup for the power revelation!
   ```

5. **Task Completes, Next Starts** (todo list updates)
   ```
   üìã Todo List Updated:
   ‚úÖ Read Chapter 4 to understand the cliffhanger  
   üîß Create Chapter 5 outline with action scene  
   ‚òê Write the action scene  
   ...
   ```

6. **Subagent Delegation** (user sees this)
   ```
   I'm delegating the outline creation to the planning-agent who 
   specializes in story structure. This will ensure we have a solid 
   framework before writing.
   
   [Planning agent working...]
   ```

7. **Planning Agent Returns** (streaming continues)
   ```
   The planning-agent has created a detailed Chapter 5 outline:
   
   # Chapter 5: Fire and Revelation
   
   ## Scene 1: Desperate Escape (Fast pacing)
   - Kira surrounded, archive burning
   - Instinctive power activation
   - Soldiers thrown back by unseen force
   ...
   
   This looks excellent! Let me move forward with writing.
   ```

8. **Multiple Tasks in Parallel** (todo list shows multiple in progress)
   ```
   üìã Todo List Updated:
   ‚úÖ Read Chapter 4 to understand the cliffhanger  
   ‚úÖ Create Chapter 5 outline with action scene  
   üîß Write the action scene  
   üîß Write character development sections  
   ‚òê Ensure smooth connection to Chapter 4  
   ...
   ```

9. **Agents Working in Parallel** (user informed)
   ```
   I'm launching two writing-agent subagents in parallel to work on:
   1. The action scene (Scene 1-2)
   2. The character development sections (Scene 3-4)
   
   This will be faster than working sequentially.
   
   [Both agents working simultaneously...]
   ```

10. **Content Delivered** (streaming prose)
    ```
    Here's the drafted Chapter 5:
    
    ---
    
    The flames roared closer, heat pressing against Kira's skin like a 
    physical force. Smoke burned her lungs with each gasping breath. 
    The soldiers advanced, weapons drawn, cutting off every escape route.
    
    She was going to die here.
    
    The thought crystallized with terrifying clarity...
    
    [Full chapter content streams in]
    ```

11. **Quality Review** (automatic)
    ```
    üìã Todo List Updated:
    ‚úÖ Write the action scene  
    ‚úÖ Write character development sections  
    üîß Review and refine Chapter 5  
    ...
    
    Let me review the chapter for consistency and quality...
    
    [Editing agent reviews content]
    
    The editing-agent found a few minor improvements. I've applied them.
    ```

12. **Progress Documentation** (automatic)
    ```
    üìã Todo List Updated:
    ‚úÖ Read Chapter 4 to understand the cliffhanger  
    ‚úÖ Create Chapter 5 outline with action scene  
    ‚úÖ Write the action scene  
    ‚úÖ Write character development sections  
    ‚úÖ Ensure smooth connection to Chapter 4  
    ‚úÖ Review and refine Chapter 5  
    üîß Create progress file documenting work  
    
    I'm creating a progress file to document this session's work...
    
    Progress file created: progress_session_20251005_143000.md
    ```

13. **Final Summary** (completion)
    ```
    ‚úÖ Chapter 5 Complete!
    
    I've successfully written Chapter 5 with:
    - Action scene showing Kira's power revelation
    - Character development showing her acceptance
    - Smooth connection to Chapter 4's cliffhanger
    - ~3,500 words of polished prose
    
    Files created/modified:

    Next suggested steps:
    - Review and edit Chapter 5
    - Write Chapter 6 outline
    - Update character profile for Kira with new powers
    ```

**Total Time:** ~5-8 minutes for complete chapter  
**User Interaction:** Minimal - mostly monitoring progress  
**Files Created:** 2 (chapter + progress file)

### Scenario 2: Simple Question (No Todo List)

**User Request:**
> "What's a good name for my villain?"

**What the User Sees:**

1. **Immediate Response** (no todo list created)
   ```
   For a compelling villain name, consider the character's traits and 
   role in your story. Here are some suggestions:
   
   **For a sophisticated, calculating antagonist:**
   - Malachi Vex
   - Cassian Drake
   - Severus Thorne
   
   **For a mysterious, shadowy villain:**
   - The Shade
   - Cipher
   - Umbra
   
   **For a brutal, physical threat:**
   - Kael Ironfist
   - Thorne the Reaver
   - Draven Bloodhammer
   
   What type of personality and role does your villain have? That will 
   help me suggest more fitting names.
   ```

**Total Time:** < 5 seconds  
**User Interaction:** Question answered directly  
**Rationale:** Simple request doesn't need planning or todo tracking  

---

### Scenario 3: Complex Multi-Part Request

**User Request:**
> "Help me develop Act 2 of my novel. I need to outline the key plot points, develop the antagonist's motivations, and write the midpoint crisis scene."

**What the User Sees:**

1. **Analysis and Planning**
   ```
   I'll help you develop Act 2 comprehensively. This is a substantial 
   undertaking with multiple independent components, so I'll create a 
   plan and use specialized subagents for each part.
   
   üìã Todo List Created:
   ‚òê Read Act 1 to understand established plot  
   ‚òê Create Act 2 outline with key plot points  
   ‚òê Develop antagonist's motivations deeply  
   ‚òê Write midpoint crisis scene outline  
   ‚òê Draft midpoint crisis scene  
   ‚òê Review all elements for consistency  
   ‚òê Create context notes for story decisions  
   ```

2. **Sequential Execution with Context Building**
   ```
   üîß Reading Act 1...
   
   Act 1 establishes:
   - Protagonist Kira discovering her heritage
   - Antagonist Lord Vex hunting for ancient artifacts
   - The Emberstone as the MacGuffin
   - Alliance with Daren formed
   
   ‚úÖ Act 1 context understood
   ```

3. **Parallel Subagent Delegation**
   ```
   Now I'll work on the three main components in parallel:
   
   1. Planning-agent: Creating Act 2 outline
   2. Writing-agent: Developing antagonist motivations
   3. Planning-agent: Outlining midpoint crisis
   
   All three agents are working simultaneously...
   ```

4. **Results Synthesis**
   ```
   All three subagents have completed their work. Let me synthesize 
   the results:
   
   ## Act 2 Structure
   [Detailed outline from planning-agent]
   
   ## Antagonist: Lord Vex
   [Deep character analysis from writing-agent]
   
   ## Midpoint Crisis: The Betrayal
   [Scene outline from planning-agent]
   
   These three elements work together cohesively...
   ```

5. **Follow-up Work**
   ```
   üîß Drafting the midpoint crisis scene...
   
   [Writing-agent writes full scene]
   
   ‚úÖ Midpoint scene drafted (2,800 words)
   ```

6. **Documentation and Continuity**
   ```
   üîß Creating context notes for future sessions...
   
   Context notes created:
   - act2_structure.md (plot outline)
   - antagonist_development.md (Lord Vex deep dive)
   - midpoint_decisions.md (key story choices)
   
   Progress file created documenting all Act 2 development work.
   ```

7. **Completion Summary**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Act 2 Development Complete!
   
   Delivered:
   - Complete Act 2 outline (15 chapters mapped)
   - Deep antagonist character development
   - Midpoint crisis scene (fully drafted, 2,800 words)
   - Context notes for continuity
   
   Files created:
   - act2_outline.md
   - antagonist_profile.md
   - chapter_midpoint.md
   - Various context notes
   
   This gives you a solid foundation for writing Act 2!
   ```

**Total Time:** ~12-18 minutes  
**User Interaction:** Monitoring progress, reading results  
**Parallelization:** Yes - multiple subagents worked simultaneously

**What User Sees:**
```
The writing-agent encountered an issue while drafting the scene. 
Let me try a different approach and write it directly.

[Continues work without user needing to do anything]
```

**Scenario:** Complex request is unclear

**What User Sees:**
```
I want to make sure I understand your request correctly. You mentioned 
writing Chapter 5 - should this:
1. Continue directly from Chapter 4's ending?
2. Include the action scene you outlined earlier?
3. Match the tone of the previous chapters?

Please clarify so I can deliver exactly what you need.
