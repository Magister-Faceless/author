    """
    Create an elite deep research subagent powered by Perplexity's sonar-deep-research model.
    
    This subagent represents the pinnacle of AI research capability, featuring:
    - Exhaustive research across hundreds of sources
    - Expert-level analysis with 128K context length
    - Comprehensive report generation (10,000+ words)
    - Advanced reasoning with configurable computational effort
    - Automatic file-based output to prevent context overflow
    
    IMPORTANT: This agent requires human approval before execution due to:
    - High computational cost and resource usage
    - Long execution time (potentially 5-15 minutes)
    - Comprehensive analysis that may consume significant API credits
    - Generation of extensive reports that require file storage
    
    The agent will:
    1. Plan comprehensive research methodology
    2. Execute exhaustive research using sonar-deep-research model
    3. Generate detailed reports (typically 10,000+ words)
    4. Save all findings to files to preserve full analysis
    5. Provide executive summary for immediate review
