## Key Concepts Summary

### Current System (OpenRouter)
```
User Input ‚Üí ChatPanel 
          ‚Üí IPC (agent:send-message)
          ‚Üí AgentManager
          ‚Üí OpenRouterAgentService
          ‚Üí OpenRouter API
          ‚Üí Stream chunks back through IPC
          ‚Üí ChatPanel displays
```

### New System (Claude SDK)
```
User Input ‚Üí ChatPanel
          ‚Üí IPC (agent:send-message)
          ‚Üí AgentManager
          ‚Üí ClaudeAgentService
          ‚Üí Claude SDK query()
          ‚Üí Process SDKMessage stream
          ‚Üí Map to current event types
          ‚Üí Emit through IPC
          ‚Üí ChatPanel displays (unchanged)
```

**Key Advantage:** Frontend (ChatPanel) requires minimal or no changes!

## Critical Success Factors

### ‚úÖ Must-Haves

1. **Streaming Input Mode**
   - Required for custom MCP tools
   - Use async generator, not string prompt
   
2. **Partial Messages Enabled**
   - Set `includePartialMessages: true`
   - Essential for real-time streaming
   
3. **Correct Tool Naming**
   - Format: `mcp__{server}__{tool}`
   - Example: `mcp__author-tools__write_progress_file`
   
4. **Session ID Tracking**
   - Capture from `system/init` message
   - Save for conversation continuity
   
5. **Event Mapping**
   - Transform SDK messages to current event types
   - Maintain compatibility with frontend

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

1. Using string prompt with MCP servers
2. Forgetting `includePartialMessages: true`
3. Wrong MCP tool name format
4. Not capturing session IDs
5. Blocking the event loop in message processing
6. IPC channel validation issues
7. Missing tool permissions
8. Generator never completing
