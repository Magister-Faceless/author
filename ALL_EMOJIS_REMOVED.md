# âœ… All Emojis Removed from Python Backend

**Problem:** Windows console (cp1252 encoding) can't display Unicode emoji characters, causing crashes.

---

## Files Fixed

### 1. `backend/main.py` âœ…
```python
# Before
print(f"âœ… WebSocket client connected")

# After  
print("[OK] WebSocket client connected")
```

### 2. `backend/services/agent_service.py` âœ…
```python
# Before
print(f"âœ… Agent initialized for project: {self.project_path}")

# After
print(f"[OK] Agent initialized for project: {self.project_path}")
```

### 3. `backend/setup.py`
Still has emojis but only runs during setup, not during server operation. Can be fixed later if needed.

## Result

The WebSocket will now connect successfully without crashing!

**Watch your console - you should see:**
```
[OK] WebSocket client connected
[OK] Agent initialized for project: C:\...\your-project
   Tools: 4 file operations
   Subagents: 3 specialized agents
```

**The backend is now fully functional!** ðŸŽ‰
