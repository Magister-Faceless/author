We are currently working on the Author project, all guideline documents for the Author project are in C:\Users\netfl\OneDrive\Desktop\author\AUTHOR_GUIDE. when performing any development on the Author project, ALWAYS refer to the guidelines in this directory and make sure that the development is in line with the guideline. 
C:\Users\netfl\OneDrive\Desktop\author\AUTHOR_PROGRESS contains all files on the progress of the Author project. when performing development on the Author project, refer to the necessary files in this directory to make sure that what you are developing is building on top of what has already been built.
However, when creating agents, subagents, tools, planning tools integration, file management tools integration, use the reference for the claude agents sdk as the main guideline, the guideline is in the files in the directory: C:\Users\netfl\OneDrive\Desktop\author\REFERENCES\claude_agent_sdk these are the PRIMARY source of truth for creating agents, subagents, tools, planning tools integration, file management tools integration.
