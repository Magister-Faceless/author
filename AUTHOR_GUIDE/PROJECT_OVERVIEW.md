# Author - AI-Powered Book Writing Desktop Application

## Project Vision
**Author** is a revolutionary desktop application that brings the power of agentic AI coding assistants to the world of book writing. Inspired by cutting-edge IDEs like Windsurf, Cursor, and Claude Code, Author provides writers with intelligent AI agents that can plan, structure, write, edit, and manage entire book projects.

## Core Concept
Just as coding IDEs revolutionized software development with intelligent assistants, Author aims to transform book writing by providing:
- **Multi-agent AI system** for different aspects of writing (planning, research, writing, editing)
- **Local file management** with full control over book projects
- **Context-aware assistance** that understands your entire manuscript
- **Planning capabilities** for plot development, character arcs, and story structure
- **Modern desktop interface** built with Electron for cross-platform compatibility

## Key Differentiators
- **Book-specific AI agents** trained for narrative structure, character development, and literary techniques
- **Project-based workflow** similar to coding IDEs but optimized for manuscripts
- **Local-first approach** ensuring complete control over your intellectual property
- **Multi-format support** (novels, non-fiction, screenplays, academic papers)
- **Collaborative editing** with AI agents that understand writing context

## Target Users
- **Professional Authors** writing novels, series, or non-fiction books
- **Academic Writers** working on research papers, dissertations, or textbooks
- **Content Creators** developing long-form content, courses, or documentation
- **Screenwriters** crafting scripts and treatments
- **Publishers and Editors** managing multiple manuscripts and authors

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Electron + React + TypeScript
- **AI Engine**: Claude Agents SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js with local file system operations
- **Database**: Local SQLite for project metadata and settings
- **UI Framework**: Modern component library (shadcn/ui or similar)
- **File Management**: Native file system APIs with cross-platform support

## Success Metrics
- Reduce book writing time by 40-60%
- Improve manuscript quality through AI-assisted editing
- Streamline the planning and outlining process
- Provide seamless local file management
- Achieve cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Core architecture and basic AI integration (Months 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Advanced agent capabilities and file management (Months 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: UI/UX refinement and testing (Months 5-6)
- **Phase 4**: Beta testing and final optimizations (Months 7-8)

## Competitive Advantage
Author will be the first desktop application to combine:
1. The agentic AI capabilities of modern coding IDEs
2. Book-specific intelligence and workflows
3. Complete local control over manuscripts
4. Professional-grade project management for writers
