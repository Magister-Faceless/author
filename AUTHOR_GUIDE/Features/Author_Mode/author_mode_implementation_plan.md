# Author Mode Implementation Plan

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Feature**: Transform Agent Selector into "Author Mode" Selector  
**Goal**: Support different writing types (Fiction, Non-Fiction, Academic, etc.) without major architectural changes

---

## Executive Summary

The current agent dropdown in the center column (MultiTabEditor) will be repurposed as an "Author Mode" selector. This allows users to select the type of book they're writing, which dynamically adjusts agent prompts and behavior without requiring multiple agent instances or significant architectural changes.

**Decision**: Maintain single agent architecture with dynamic prompt templates based on selected mode.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Agent Dropdown Location
- **File**: `src/renderer/components/MultiTabEditor.tsx`
- **Lines**: 106-127
- **Current Function**: Calls `electronAPI.agent.listAvailable()` to populate dropdown
- **Current Options**: Shows agent names (Planning Agent, Writing Agent, Editing Agent)

### Current Agent Prompts Analysis

**Main Agent** (`backend/prompts/main_agent.py`):
- ‚úÖ Relatively general (can work for multiple genres)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some fiction-specific language ("story", "plot", "characters")
- ‚úÖ Core capabilities are universal (planning, writing, editing)

**Subagent Prompts** (`backend/prompts/subagents.py`):

1. **Planning Agent**: 
   - ‚ùå Heavily fiction-focused (plot arcs, character arcs, three-act structure)
   - ‚ùå Examples use narrative fiction terminology
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Would need adaptation for academic/non-fiction

2. **Writing Agent**:
   - ‚ùå Fiction-specific (prose, dialogue, scenes, character voice)
   - ‚ùå Genre specialization section is all fiction genres
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs significant adaptation for non-fiction

3. **Editing Agent**:
   - ‚úÖ More universal (grammar, clarity, consistency)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Some fiction bias (plot holes, character consistency)
   - ‚úÖ Could work for most book types with minor tweaks

### Conclusion
**Current prompts are heavily fiction-biased and would not work well for academic or non-fiction books.**

## Recommended Approach: Dynamic Prompt Templates

### Architecture Decision

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Single Agent with Dynamic Prompts**

**Why This Approach**:
1. ‚úÖ No architectural changes needed
2. ‚úÖ Maintains current agent infrastructure
3. ‚úÖ Easy to implement and test
4. ‚úÖ Fast path to production
5. ‚úÖ Can be enhanced later with more sophisticated routing

**How It Works**:
1. User selects "Author Mode" from dropdown (Fiction, Non-Fiction, Academic, etc.)
2. Mode selection is passed to backend with each message
3. Backend dynamically selects appropriate prompt templates
4. Main agent and subagents use mode-specific prompts
5. Tools remain the same (file operations work for all modes)

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Frontend Changes (MultiTabEditor.tsx)

**Replace Agent Selector with Author Mode Selector**:

```typescript
// Instead of loading agents, define modes
const authorModes = [
  { id: 'fiction', name: 'Fiction Writing', icon: 'üìñ' },
  { id: 'non-fiction', name: 'Non-Fiction', icon: 'üìö' },
  { id: 'academic', name: 'Academic/Scholarly', icon: 'üéì' },
  { id: 'technical', name: 'Technical/Professional', icon: '‚öôÔ∏è' },
  { id: 'childrens', name: "Children's/YA", icon: 'üåü' },
  { id: 'poetry', name: 'Poetry/Creative', icon: '‚ú®' }
];

const [selectedMode, setSelectedMode] = useState<string>('fiction');
```

**Update Dropdown UI**:
```typescript
<select
  value={selectedMode}
  onChange={(e) => setSelectedMode(e.target.value)}
  style={{...}}
>
  {authorModes.map(mode => (
    <option key={mode.id} value={mode.id}>
      {mode.icon} {mode.name}
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```

**Pass Mode to Backend**:
- Store selected mode in app state
- Include mode in WebSocket messages to backend
- Backend uses mode to select appropriate prompts

### 2. Backend Changes

#### A. Create Prompt Template System

**New File**: `backend/prompts/prompt_templates.py`

```python
"""
Dynamic prompt templates for different author modes
"""

# Main Agent Templates
MAIN_AGENT_TEMPLATES = {
    'fiction': FICTION_MAIN_AGENT_PROMPT,
    'non-fiction': NON_FICTION_MAIN_AGENT_PROMPT,
    'academic': ACADEMIC_MAIN_AGENT_PROMPT,
    # ... more modes
}

# Subagent Templates
PLANNING_AGENT_TEMPLATES = {
    'fiction': FICTION_PLANNING_PROMPT,
    'non-fiction': NON_FICTION_PLANNING_PROMPT,
    'academic': ACADEMIC_PLANNING_PROMPT,
    # ... more modes
}

# Similar for writing and editing agents
```

#### B. Modify AgentService to Accept Mode

**File**: `backend/services/agent_service.py`

```python
class AgentService:
    def __init__(self, project_path: str, author_mode: str = 'fiction'):
        self.project_path = Path(project_path).resolve()
        self.author_mode = author_mode
        self.agent = None
        self._initialize_agent()
    
    def _initialize_agent(self):
        # Get mode-specific prompts
        main_prompt = get_main_agent_prompt(self.author_mode)
        subagent_configs = get_subagent_configs(self.author_mode)
        
        # Create agent with mode-specific prompts
        self.agent = async_create_deep_agent(
            tools=file_tools,
            instructions=main_prompt,
            model=model,
            subagents=subagent_configs,
        )
    
    def change_mode(self, new_mode: str):
        """Change author mode and reinitialize agent"""
        self.author_mode = new_mode
        self._initialize_agent()
```

#### C. Update WebSocket Protocol

**File**: `backend/main.py`

```python
# Add mode to initialization
if message_type == "init":
    project_path = data.get("project_path")
    author_mode = data.get("author_mode", "fiction")
    
    agent_service = AgentService(project_path, author_mode)
    # ...

# Add mode change handler
elif message_type == "change_mode":
    new_mode = data.get("mode")
    if agent_service:
        agent_service.change_mode(new_mode)
        await websocket.send_json({
            "type": "mode_changed",
            "mode": new_mode
        })
```
