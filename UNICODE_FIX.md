# ✅ Fixed: Unicode Encoding Error

**Error:**
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 2-49
```

**Cause:** Windows console (cp1252 encoding) can't display Unicode box drawing characters:
```
╔══╗  ← These fancy characters
```

**Fix:** Changed to simple ASCII characters:
```python
# Before
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          Author Backend Server               ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝

# After
==================================================
  Author Backend Server
  Powered by DeepAgents & FastAPI
==================================================
```

## 🎯 The App Should Now Start!

The Python file has been updated. Just **wait a moment** for it to retry, or **restart the app** if needed.

**You should see:**
```
==================================================
  Author Backend Server
  Powered by DeepAgents & FastAPI
==================================================

Starting server at http://127.0.0.1:8765
WebSocket endpoint: ws://127.0.0.1:8765/ws/agent
```

Then shortly after:
```
✅ Python backend is ready
✅ Connected to Python backend WebSocket
✅ Agent initialized for project
```

---

**Almost there! The backend will start successfully now!** 🎉
