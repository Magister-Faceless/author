# ✅ Fixed: Python Backend Import Error

**Error:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'
Python backend exited with code 1
```

---

## 🔧 Problem

`backend/main.py` was trying to import:
```python
from backend.services import AgentService  # ❌ Can't find 'backend'
from backend.config import HOST, PORT
```

When Python runs from the `backend/` directory, it doesn't recognize `backend` as a module.

---

## ✅ Solution

Changed to local imports:

```python
# Add current directory to path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))

# Import from local modules
from services import AgentService  # ✅ Works!
from config import HOST, PORT
```

---

## 🎯 What to Do Now

The Python backend should now start successfully!

**Wait for webpack to recompile** (it's in watch mode), or **restart the app**:

1. Stop npm start (Ctrl+C)
2. Run `npm start` again
3. Open/create a project
4. Watch console for:
   ```
   Starting Python backend...
   [Python Backend] Starting server at http://127.0.0.1:8765
   ✅ Python backend is ready
   ✅ DeepAgents initialized successfully
   ```

**The Python backend will now start correctly!** 🚀
