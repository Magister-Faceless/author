# Claude SDK Migration Guide Creation - Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Session Focus**: Creating comprehensive migration documentation  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  

---

## Objective

Create a comprehensive, multi-part migration guide to transition the Author desktop application from the current OpenRouter-based agent service to the Claude Agents SDK. The guide should cover current architecture, SDK patterns, implementation steps, and pitfalls to avoid.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Documentation Structure Planning

**Decision:** Multi-file approach
- Reasoning: Single file would exceed token limits (8,192 tokens max)
- Solution: 4 focused documents + 1 index/overview
- Each part covers a specific aspect of migration

### 2. Part 1: Current Architecture & Event Flow Analysis

**File Created:** `MIGRATION_PART1_CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Contents:**
- Technology stack overview (Electron, OpenRouter, React)
- Detailed architecture diagrams showing current flow
- Streaming event flow explanation
- IPC communication layer security architecture
- Lessons learned from previous streaming fix
- What works well vs. what needs migration

**Key Insights Documented:**
- Frontend requires minimal changes due to event abstraction
- IPC channel validation is critical (learned from streaming fix)
- Virtual file system already in place for context management
- Event-driven architecture allows clean service swap

### 3. Part 2: Claude SDK Integration Patterns

**File Created:** `MIGRATION_PART2_SDK_PATTERNS.md`

**Contents:**
- Claude SDK core concepts and philosophy
- Complete `query()` function documentation
- Message types (SDKMessage, SDKAssistantMessage, etc.)
- Streaming patterns with `includePartialMessages`
- Subagent architecture and programmatic definitions
- Custom MCP tool development with `createSdkMcpServer`
- Session management (capture, resume, fork)
- Electron-specific integration patterns

**Key Patterns Documented:**
- Async generator requirement for MCP tools
- Message type handling and transformation
- Event mapping from SDK to current event system
- Subagent delegation patterns for book writing
- Tool naming convention: `mcp__{server}__{tool}`

### 4. Part 3: Migration Implementation Guide

**File Created:** `MIGRATION_PART3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Contents:**
- 7-step migration process
- Complete, production-ready `ClaudeAgentService` implementation
- Custom MCP tools for Author app (progress files, context notes, etc.)
- Agent Manager updates with feature flag logic
- Subagent definitions for Planning, Writing, Editing agents
- Testing checklist and integration validation
- Gradual rollout strategy with rollback plan

**Implementation Highlights:**
- **Feature flag approach:** `USE_CLAUDE_SDK` for safe testing
- **Parallel implementation:** Keep OpenRouter during migration
- **Full code examples:** Copy-paste ready TypeScript code
- **Custom tools:**
  - `write_progress_file` - Session tracking
  - `write_context_note` - Knowledge preservation
  - `read_virtual_file` - Access previous session data
  - `create_session_summary` - Continuity management

**Subagent Specialization:**
- Planning Agent: Outlines, plot structures, story planning
- Writing Agent: Prose, dialogue, narrative content (Opus model)
- Editing Agent: Refinement, consistency, quality control

### 5. Part 4: Pitfalls, Testing & Validation

**File Created:** `MIGRATION_PART4_PITFALLS_TESTING.md`

**Contents:**
- 8 critical pitfalls with detailed explanations and solutions
- Lessons from previous streaming fix (IPC channel blocking)
- Comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, manual)
- Debugging guide with common issues and solutions
- Performance optimization techniques
- Complete validation checklist
- Production readiness requirements

**Critical Pitfalls Documented:**
1. Using string prompt with MCP tools (must use async generator)
2. Incorrect tool naming (missing `mcp__` prefix)
3. Not enabling `includePartialMessages` (no streaming chunks)
4. Blocking the event loop (synchronous processing)
5. Not handling session IDs (lost continuity)
6. IPC channel validation issues (learned from streaming fix)
7. Tool permission issues (missing from `allowedTools`)
8. Async generator completion problems

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for ClaudeAgentService
- Integration tests for streaming flow
- Manual testing checklist (20+ items)
- Performance benchmarks and targets

### 6. Migration Index & Overview

**File Created:** `CLAUDE_SDK_MIGRATION_INDEX.md`

**Contents:**
- Complete guide overview and navigation
- Quick start instructions (6-8 hour estimate)
- Key concepts summary (current vs. new system)
- Critical success factors checklist
- Comprehensive migration checklist
- Support resources and troubleshooting
- Expected outcomes and success metrics

**Purpose:**
- Single entry point for the migration
- Roadmap for developers
- Quick reference for key information
- Links all parts together coherently

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Event Compatibility Layer

**Decision:** Map SDK messages to existing event types
**Rationale:**
- Minimal frontend changes required
- Easier rollback if needed
- Gradual migration path
- Preserves working UI

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// SDK message → Current event
stream_event.content_block_delta → agent:stream-chunk
assistant message → agent:message
result message → agent:stream-end
```

### 2. Feature Flag Strategy

**Decision:** Use `USE_CLAUDE_SDK` environment variable
**Rationale:**
- Safe A/B testing
- Easy rollback (just flip flag)
- Can test in production with subset of users
- No code removal until validated

### 3. Async Generator for Message Stream

**Decision:** Use async generator pattern for prompts
**Rationale:**
- Required for custom MCP tools
- Enables dynamic message queueing
- Supports interruption via `interrupt()`
- Matches SDK's recommended pattern

### 4. Custom MCP Tools Integration

**Decision:** Build Author-specific tools in same server
**Rationale:**
- Single MCP server easier to manage
- All tools share VirtualFileManager instance
- Consistent naming convention
- Simpler configuration

### 5. Subagent Specialization

**Decision:** Three specialized agents (Planning, Writing, Editing)
**Rationale:**
- Matches book writing workflow
- Different models for different quality needs
- Tool restrictions for safety
- Clear delegation boundaries
