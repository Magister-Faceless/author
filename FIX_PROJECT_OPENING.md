# ✅ Fixed: Project Opening/Creation Not Responding

**Issue**: Creating or opening folders/projects appeared to hang with no response.

**Root Cause**: The `initializeDeepAgents()` call was **blocking** - waiting 30+ seconds for Python backend to start before returning the project to the UI.

---

## 🔧 Solution

Changed from **blocking** to **non-blocking** initialization:

### Before (Blocking) ❌
```typescript
// Wait for DeepAgents to fully initialize before returning
const project = await this.projectManager.createProject(data);
await this.agentManager.initializeDeepAgents(project.path);  // ❌ Blocks!
return project;  // UI waits here
```

**Result**: UI freezes for 30+ seconds while Python starts.

---

### After (Non-Blocking) ✅
```typescript
// Return immediately, initialize in background
const project = await this.projectManager.createProject(data);
this.agentManager.initializeDeepAgents(project.path).catch(error => {
  this.logger.error('Failed to initialize DeepAgents:', error);
});  // ✅ Runs in background
return project;  // UI responds immediately
```

**Result**: 
1. ✅ Project opens/creates instantly
2. ✅ Python backend starts in background
3. ✅ Agent ready after ~10-30 seconds
4. ✅ User can continue working while it starts

---

## 🎯 New Behavior

### When You Create/Open a Project:

1. **Immediate** - Project opens in UI (< 1 second)
2. **Background** - Console shows:
   ```
   Starting Python backend...
   [Python Backend] Starting server...
   ✅ Python backend is ready
   ✅ DeepAgents initialized
   ```
3. **Ready** - Agent becomes available after Python fully starts

---

## ✅ Testing

Webpack should auto-recompile. If not, the changes are already applied.

**Test it:**
1. Try creating a new project → Should open instantly ✅
2. Try opening existing project → Should open instantly ✅
3. Watch console → Python starts in background
4. Wait ~10-30 seconds → Agent ready
5. Send a message → Agent responds ✅

## 📝 Technical Details

**Changed files**: `src/main/main.ts`

**Changed handlers**:
- `IPC_CHANNELS.PROJECT_CREATE`
- `IPC_CHANNELS.PROJECT_OPEN`

**Pattern**: Fire-and-forget with error handling
```typescript
this.agentManager.initializeDeepAgents(projectPath)
  .catch(error => this.logger.error('...', error));
```

**The UI is now responsive while Python backend initializes!** 🚀
