# âœ… Fixed: No Response Streaming

**Problem:** Agent initialized successfully but no response when sending messages.

```
Got response from agentService: undefined
content: '{}'
```

---

## Root Cause

`AgentManager.executeQuery()` was awaiting a return value from `DeepAgentService.sendMessage()`:

```typescript
const response = await this.agentService.sendMessage(prompt);  // Returns void!
```

But DeepAgents works differently:
- **Other agents** (Claude/OpenRouter): Return response directly
- **DeepAgents**: Emit events (`stream-chunk`, `todos`, etc.) - no return value

The code was waiting for a return value that never came, so it returned `undefined`.

---

## Solution

Added conditional handling based on agent type:

```typescript
// For DeepAgents, response comes through events
if (this.useDeepAgents) {
  await this.agentService.sendMessage(prompt);
  // Return empty array - actual response comes through stream events
  return [];
}

// For other agents, await response
const response = await this.agentService.sendMessage(prompt);
return [this.convertToAgentMessage({ content: response })];
```

## How It Works Now

### Flow for DeepAgents:

1. **User sends message** â†’ AgentManager.sendMessage()
2. **Message sent to Python** â†’ DeepAgentService.sendMessage()  
3. **Python streams response** â†’ Emits WebSocket events
4. **Events captured** â†’ DeepAgentService emits Node events
5. **Events forwarded** â†’ AgentManager â†’ Renderer (UI)
6. **UI updates** â†’ Real-time streaming text!

---

## Result

âœ… Messages sent to Python backend  
âœ… Python processes and streams back  
âœ… Events flow through WebSocket â†’ DeepAgentService â†’ AgentManager â†’ UI  
âœ… Real-time streaming in chat interface!

---

## Test Again

Webpack should recompile automatically. Send your message again:

```
"Help me plan a fantasy romance webnovel titled immortal sorcerer"
```

You should see:
- âœ… Python backend logs showing message received
- âœ… Agent processing
- âœ… Text streaming in UI  
- âœ… Todo list updates (if agent creates one)

**The agent will now respond with streaming!** ðŸŽ‰
